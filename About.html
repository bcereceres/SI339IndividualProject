    <p class="AboutBody">We are an independent company that believes everyone should have a smile on their face during this holiday season, a goal that we've been working towards for years.  </p>
    
            <h2 class="AboutBody"><em>What do we do to achieve that goal?</em></h2>
    
    <p class="AboutBody">We search far and wide to compare things such as flight deals, events, parties, and activities from all across the world and bring them straight into the fingertips of our users. We also set up fundraisers to donate money to those in need every December Holiday season.</p>
            
            <h2 class="AboutBody"><em>What you can do to help:</em></h2>
    
    <p class="AboutBody">If you share the same interests as we do and you want to help, head on over to our Donate tab! 100% of that funding will go straight towards families in need this holiday.</p>
